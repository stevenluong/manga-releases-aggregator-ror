<h2>About Me</h2>
<div class="well">
<p>
My name is <a href="http://www.steven-luong.com">Steven Luong</a>, 
I am a junior IT engineer.
<br/>
<br/>
I've built this app for 2 reasons : 
<ul>
<li>First, there are too many manga publishers 
and I got bored from visiting each of them; </li>
<li>
Second, I think that it is fun coding 
and it was the best way to learn and practice on ROR & Node.js.
</li>
</ul>
I hope that this app will be as useful for you as it is for me !
